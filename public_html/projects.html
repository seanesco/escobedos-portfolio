            <P>This is the first project on programming because i never do 
                anything like this before
            aka ( this whole website ).<br /> All of this website was made form 
            using the programs called HTML ,
            CCS , and Netbeans<br /> which i actually thought would be a lot more
            harder to use and just straight 
            up confusing because<br /> it just seemed like it would be from like 
            how i used to hear some programmers
            talk to each other.<br /> We are all creating this portfolio project to 
            describe us and to show the people who read this what we're able to do. 
            <br />This project will mostly have what we are programs we're using , how we're using them
            ,how they work ect.<br /> We will soon be working on a soon to be mario like
            game and a game called snake.</P>
