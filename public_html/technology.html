            <p class="center"> we are using the programs HTML & CSS to do our projects.
            HTML is the main program that deals with coding and just the program 
            that holds all of the website
            / programs together.</p>
            <p>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language 
                used to create web pages.
                <br />HTML is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed 
               in angle brackets (like html). 
               <br />HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like h1 and /h1, 
               although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example img.
               <br />The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag 
               (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
               <br />A web browser can read<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">HTML files and compose them into visible or audible web pages. 
               <br />The browser does not display the HTML tags, 
               but uses them to interpret the content of the page.<br /> HTML describes the structure of 
               a website semantically along with cues for presentation, 
               making it a markup language rather than a programming language.
               <br />HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites.<br /> HTML allows images and objects to be embedded 
               and can be used to create interactive forms. 
               <br />It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as<br /> 
               headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. 
               It can embed scripts written in languages such 
               as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages.</p>
